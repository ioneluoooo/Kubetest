so you only need the Service and Deployment kinds (only two resource definitios)
but for a database component should consist of THREE resource definitios
PersistentStorage, Service, Deployment

*If a Service does not have a type field, Kubernetes assigns it the default type ClusterIP.

Firstly build your docker image

"docker build -t "title" ."

then push the image to the docker hub, but firstly tag it
"docker tag <image_name> <username>/<image_name>:1.0.0"
then login
"docker login"
then push it
"docker push <username>/<image_name>:1.0.0"

the next step you will start your minikube 
"minikube start"
after that you should submit your resource definitions to Kubernetes with the following
"kubectl apply -f <your_path_to_resources>" (the YAML file)

You can watch your Pods coming alive with:
"kubectl get pods --watch"

As soon as the Pods are in the Running state, your app is ready.

You can access it now through your Service
"minikube service <your_service_name> --url

You can remove the app from the cluster with 
"kubectl delete -f <your_path_to_resources>
